\maketitle
\section{Overview} In behalf of organization committee, I would like
to welcome you to the $10^{\mbox{th}}$ annual Carolina Dynamics
Symposium held at Clemson University. The theme of the meeting is the
new developments in Dynamical Systems, relations to other branches of
mathematics and applications. The $10^{\mbox{th}}$ annual meeting of the
Carolina Dynamical Systems group is an opportunity to reflect on humbled
origins of the group and the history of dynamical systems in the
Southeast. Unlike previous years, we have grown some and that shows in
the format of the conference. For the first time we have invited
speakers:

\begin{itemize}
\item Yuliy Baryshnikov, Urbana;
\item Robert Connelly, Cornell;
\item Sheldon Newhouse, Michigan State;
\item Sergei Tabachnikov, Penn State.
\end{itemize}

We also have a special Sunday session on Control and Robotics. During
the conference, we will pay a tribute to the life and work of recently
deceased Russian mathematician Leonid Pavlovich Shilnikov whose
scientific work in the field of Dynamical Systems has found fertile
ground among the local mathematical community.


We kick off on Friday, April 13 at 4:30 pm with a single invited lecture
by Sheldon Newhouse which will be also departmental colloquium lecture
for that week at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Clemson
University.


We gather back Saturday April 14 at 9:00 am. There would be three 60
minutes morning lectures. After the brake for the lunch we will get back
to work at 2:30 pm. At this time we will split into the several
sections. Sectional talks will be 35 minutes long with the 5 extra
minutes reserved for questions. They are an ideal opportunity for
graduate students, post-docs and recent Ph.D.s to talk about their
research.


We finish Saturday with conference banquet.

A special session on Control and Robotics is planned for Sunday, April
15 consisting of three 60 minutes invited lecture. We finish early 12:30
pm so that people can get back home and get ready for Monday teaching
duties.
