I. Have you ever considered doing a semester or a year abroad? Which university would you pick and why? Select a university from the list of HTW partner institutions or find another university that might interest you. Collect information on the following points:

* courses and modules offered at equivalent faculties,
* entrance requirements for students from Germany,
* financial assistance available for foreign students and
* on-campus facilities offered to students.

II. On the basis of your findings, write a text of ca. 200 words to explain the reasons for your choice. Use your own words and write in full sentences. Count and indicate the number of words.

Language tip:

Remember that a text is more than a sequence of sentences. You need to link your ideas properly so that the logical connection between them becomes clear. Please use the text books listed below to help you write your text.
